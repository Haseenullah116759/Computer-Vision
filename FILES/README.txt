Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods. Univariate analysis is a key part of EDA and focuses on examining one variable at a time.

Definition of Univariate Analysis:

Univariate Analysis involves the examination of a single variable to understand its distribution, central tendency, and spread.
It helps to summarize and describe the individual characteristic of a dataset, providing insights into the patterns and behavior of that specific variable.
Commonly used for both numerical and categorical data.


1.)For Numerical Variables:

Key Techniques:

Mean: The average of the values.
Median: The middle value when data is sorted.
Mode: The most frequent value.
Variance/Standard Deviation: Measure of how spread out the values are.
Visuals:

Histogram: Displays the frequency distribution of numerical data. It helps to identify the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, skewed).
Box Plot: Displays the spread and identifies outliers.



2.)For Categorical Variables:

Frequency Distribution: Count the occurrences of each category.

Bar Plot: Used to visualize the frequency of each category.

Pie Chart: Another option for visualizing categorical data, showing proportions between categories.

Example: Analyzing the frequency of different house furnishing statuses (e.g., furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished).

Key Techniques:

Frequency Count: Counting how often each category appears.
Mode: Identifying the most frequent category.
Visuals:

Bar Plot: A simple visual representation of frequency for each category.
Pie Chart: Shows the proportion of categories in the data.
